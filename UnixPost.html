<h1>Learning the Unix Way</h1>
I have recently learned some basic unix commands. So sharing a bit of it through my first technical blog.Just giving you&nbsp;a brief idea here about how vi command works. 
<h3>Vi Command</h3>
vi command launches a editor. It is basically used to edit file. Using vi you can edit the existing file or if file doesn’t exist it will create new file.If you use vi without file name it will open new file where you can enter the text and edit and while coming out you can enter a valid name and save the text.
It has two main modes of operation: command mode, and insert mode.<div style="height:20px;"></div>
i)<b>Command Mode</b> : After a file is opened it is default opened in command<br />mode , and you will not see the words you are typing on the screen.Input from the keyboard will be consider it as vi commands<br />
ii)<b>Insert Mode </b>: To enter the text you have to put vi in insert mode by pressing ‘i’ or ‘a’&nbsp; after&nbsp; which you can add the text and whatever is being type will be seen on the&nbsp; screen. . To switch between these mode Esc key is used.<br />
<br />
<strong>Examples </strong>:vi myfile.txt<br />
<a href="http://www.blogger.com/" name="03"></a>It will edit the file myfile.txt.<div style="height:10px;"></div>
:wq
Typing the above command would save the changes you have made and exit the vi editor<div style="height:20px;"></div>
We can have different option to exit vi :<br />
1) Quit without saving : If you don’t&nbsp; want to save the work :q&nbsp; will exit without saving&nbsp; your editing in vi.<br />
2) Write &amp; quit : . Simple :w saves the current file but don’t exit. For save and quit&nbsp; :wq is&nbsp; used in vi.<br />
3) Forced Quite :&nbsp;Exclamation&nbsp; sign at the end of&nbsp; exit commands ( :q! , :wq! )&nbsp; causes a forced&nbsp; quit from vi&nbsp; after ignoring editing (for :q!)&nbsp; or writing (for :wq!)&nbsp; all the change.
