<h1>What is Ignite?</h1>
Before couple of days I gave ignite talk. I found the concept of ignite talk extremely interesting.<div style="height:20px;"></div>
Those who are hearing it for first time,Ignite is event where selected participants presents their ideas on personal or professional passions and follows the format : five minutes, 20 slides, with each slide advancing automatically every 15 seconds. It's a high-energy format and a lot of fun. The aim is to inspire thinking, ideas, conversation and trigger action about various subjects.<div style="height:20px;"></div>
What is the most challenging thing about creating an Ignite talk?A five-minute talk seems like it should be pretty easy.But Trust me; it isn’t!Some people may think that its only a five minutes time, in such a short speech I really cannot make any impact.So here is the catch !&nbsp;Ignite’s mantra is: “Enlighten us but make it quick.”In fact, a shorter speeches are more impactful because you get straight to the point, rather than using filler words in&nbsp;explaining&nbsp;what you have to say in precious minutes.<div style="height:20px;"></div>
Lightning talks are a great way to start speaking,As a presneter, it is a great challenge to get to the point! As a audience, it’s awesome because you get to see tons of inspiring ideas,loads of creativity and entertainment factor!!&nbsp;How YOU feel about the speech you are giving is exactly the feeling your audience will have.If you feel good about it; your audience will feel good because you deliver the speech with confidence and passion.&nbsp;If you feel like its a waste of time, so too will your audience as your delivery will lack emotion and conviction.<div style="height:20px;"></div>
The topic I choose for ignite talk was new features of HTML5.I found HTML5 has lot of amazing features and I wanted to share it with everyone.It was a great opportunity and learning experience!<div style="height:20px;"></div>
<strong>What do you think? Is it time to dive into Ignite talk?!</strong><div style="height:20px;"></div>
