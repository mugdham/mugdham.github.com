<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i>Before couple of days I gave ignite talk. I&nbsp;found the concept of ignite talk extremely interesting.</i></span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i><br /></i></span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i>Those who are hearing it for first time,Ignite is&nbsp;event where&nbsp;selected participants presents their ideas on personal or professional passions and follows the format : five minutes, 20 slides, with each slide advancing automatically every 15 seconds.&nbsp;It's a high-energy format and a lot of fun.&nbsp;The aim is to inspire thinking, ideas, conversation and trigger action about various subjects.&nbsp;</i></span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i><br /></i></span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i>What is the most challenging thing about creating an Ignite talk?A five-minute talk seems like it should be pretty easy.But Trust me; it isn’t!Some people may think that its only a five minutes time, in such a short speech I really cannot make any impact.So here is the catch !&nbsp;Ignite’s mantra is: “Enlighten us but make it quick.”In fact, a shorter speeches are more impactful because you get straight to the point, rather than using filler words in&nbsp;explaining&nbsp;what you have to say in precious minutes.</i></span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i><br /></i></span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i>Lightning talks are a great way to start speaking,As a presneter, it is a great challenge to get to the point! As a audience, it’s awesome because you get to see tons of inspiring ideas,loads of creativity and entertainment factor!!&nbsp;How YOU feel about the speech you are giving is exactly the feeling your audience will have.If you feel good about it; your audience will feel good because you deliver the speech with confidence and passion.&nbsp;If you feel like its a waste of time, so too will your audience as your delivery will lack emotion and conviction.</i></span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i><br /></i></span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i>The topic I choose for ignite talk was new features of HTML5.I found HTML5 has lot of amazing features and I wanted to share it with everyone.&nbsp;It was a great opportunity and&nbsp;learning experience!&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></span><br />
