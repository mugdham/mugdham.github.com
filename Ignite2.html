<h1>What is Ignite?</h1>
Before couple of days I gave ignite talk. I found the concept of ignite talk extremely interesting.

Those who are hearing it for first time,Ignite is event where selected participants presents their ideas on personal or professional passions and follows the format : five minutes, 20 slides, with each slide advancing automatically every 15 seconds. It's a high-energy format and a lot of fun. The aim is to inspire thinking, ideas, conversation and trigger action about various subjects.<div style="height:20px;"></div>
What is the most challenging thing about creating an Ignite talk?A five-minute talk seems like it should be pretty easy.But Trust me; it isn't!Some people may think that its only a five minutes time, in such a short speech I really cannot make any impact.So here is the catch !&nbsp;Ignite's mantra is: "Enlighten us but make it quick."In fact, a shorter speeches are more impactful because you get straight to the point, rather than using filler words in&nbsp;explaining&nbsp;what you have to say in precious minutes.

Lightning talks are a great way to start speaking,As a presneter, it is a great challenge to get to the point! As a audience, it's awesome because you get to see tons of inspiring ideas,loads of creativity and entertainment factor!!&nbsp;How YOU feel about the speech you are giving is exactly the feeling your audience will have.If you feel good about it; your audience will feel good because you deliver the speech with confidence and passion.&nbsp;If you feel like its a waste of time, so too will your audience as your delivery will lack emotion and conviction.
